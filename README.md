# Proxy-Management-Script
The Manage-CloudflareProxies.ps1 script automates the process of enabling and disabling Cloudflare's proxy feature (the "orange cloud") for DNS records across your entire Cloudflare account. It intelligently tracks which records it has modified using DNS record comments, allowing you to easily toggle proxy settings on and off.
